# Computer Network Projects and Tasks

Welcome to my repository for **Computer Network Projects and Tasks**, designed and implemented using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. This repository showcases a variety of network configurations, simulations, and protocols explored as part of my journey in computer networking.

This repository contains hands-on network configurations and simulations that focus on real-world applications and networking concepts. It includes tasks ranging from basic network setups to advanced routing and switching techniques, implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Features

- **Basic Networking**: LAN, VLAN, and inter-VLAN configurations.
- **Routing Protocols**: RIP, OSPF, EIGRP.
- **Switching Techniques**: Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), Port Security.
- **WAN Technologies**: Frame Relay, PPP.
- **Security**: ACLs, Firewall configurations.
- **Advanced Tasks**: Network redundancy, load balancing, and QoS.

## Projects Overview

1. **LAN Configuration**
   - Simple LAN setup with multiple devices.
   - Configured static IPs and default gateways.

2. **VLAN Implementation**
   - Dividing a network into multiple VLANs for traffic segmentation.
   - Configuring trunk ports between switches.

3. **Routing Protocols**
   - Configured RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP for inter-network communication.
   - Demonstrated route summarization and redistribution.

4. **WAN Setup**
   - Implemented Frame Relay and PPP connections for wide-area communication.

5. **Access Control**
   - Configured ACLs for traffic filtering.
   - Applied firewall rules for enhanced network security.

6. **Redundancy and Load Balancing**
   - Configured HSRP and EtherChannel for network resilience.
